# crypto
Scala library for teaching cryptography ciphers



With this library I'm aiming for 2 things:

  1) Breadth of coverage. Tons of algorithms and ciphers should be available
  
  2) Modularity. Execution control should be extremely fine-grained in a usable package
  
  3) Teachability. It should be possible to "step" through each algorithm within the api
  
  -- (This requirement means more from a tooling side than for programming use)
